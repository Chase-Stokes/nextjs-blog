        <p>Hi I'm Chase! I am a Fullstack Engineer with a passion for TypeScript, Web Design, and Problem Solving. I am looking forward to the next step in my transition from the service industry into tech. Most recently I have been working as an intern for a Software company developing an app for High School students. Workign on complex features like a Rich Text Editor, Data Visualization, and custon React components has been an increduble and irreplaceable opportunity. I am certain that my experience as a cook and server, which are enviornments that only function correctly when working together, will make me a valuable asset to my future team as an engineer.</p>
